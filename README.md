Manim is a fantastic library, but rather dependency-heavy. Here are some of the things I remembered to note that I installed:

```
brew install py3cairo ffmpeg
brew install pango pkg-config scipy
conda install -c conda-forge pycairo
pip3 install importlib-metadata
pip install matplotlib notebook
pip install cmasher
pip install seaborn
conda install pydot
pip install pygraphviz
brew install sox
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui
```

And then, finally:

```
pip install manim
```
